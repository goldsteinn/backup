;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Yapfify uses yapf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
;; certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'yapf-mode' is provided
;; that turns on automatically running YAPF on a buffer before saving.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add yapfify.el to your load-path.
;;
;; To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
;; yapf-mode to python-mode-hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'yapf-mode)
;;
