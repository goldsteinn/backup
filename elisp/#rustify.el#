;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Perlify uses perlf to perl a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
;; certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'perlf-mode' is provided
;; that turns on automatically running PERLF on a buffer before saving.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add perlify.el to your load-path.
;;
;; To automatically perl all Python buffers before saving, add the function
;; perlf-mode to python-mode-hook:
