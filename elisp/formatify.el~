;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Rackify uses rackf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
;; certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'rackf-mode' is provided
;; that turns on automatically running RACKF on a buffer before saving.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add rackify.el to your load-path.
;;
;; To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
;; rackf-mode to python-mode-hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'rackf-mode)
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)


(defun formatify-call-bin (executable input-buffer output-buffer start-line end-line)
  "Call process rackf on INPUT-BUFFER saving the output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.

Return the exit code.  START-LINE and END-LINE specify region to
format."
