;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Abfify uses abf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
;; certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'abf-mode' is provided
;; that turns on automatically running ABF on a buffer before saving.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Add abfify.el to your load-path.
;;
;; To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
;; abf-mode to python-mode-hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'abf-mode)
;;
;;; Code:

Return the exit code.  START-LINE and END-LINE specify region to
format."
